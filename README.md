# Power-latching-circuit-with-arduino-and-sound-sensor

This is a simple project where the Arduino turns on when you press a button or make a sound, does its job for 10 seconds, then shuts itself off completely to save battery.


## What You’ll need 
	•	Arduino Uno
	•	IRF4905 P-channel MOSFET
	•	S8050 NPN transistor
	•	Push button
	•	Sound sensor
	•	White LED
	•	2 × 220Ω resistors
	•	3 × 100kΩ resistors
	•	1 × 10kΩ resistor
	•	2 × 1N4007 diodes
	•	9V battery
## How It Works

	1.	You press a button or make a sound.
	2.	The Arduino turns on.
	3.	It lights up the LED.
	4.	After 10 seconds, it cuts its own power.
	5.	It stays off until triggered again.

## Why Use This?

	•	Saves battery
	•	Great for short tasks
	•	Easy to build
	•	Can be upgraded with motion, light, or touch sensors
